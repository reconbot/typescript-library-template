This is an example project for shipping typescript using the rules layed out by [@southpolesteve](https://twitter.com/southpolesteve) in his ["Shipping Typescript to NPM"](https://speakerdeck.com/southpolesteve/shipping-typescript-to-npm?slide=10) talk that he gave at NYC typescript.

It gives you a library in UMD and ESM that's rolled up with rollup and includes rolled up types. It makes browser users, node users and me very happy.

Also includes tslint and mocha.
